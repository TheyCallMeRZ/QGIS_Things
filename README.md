Models and scripts for QGIS.
My ideas that surprisingly worked :D 
In case of any question feel free to messege me, comment or send me an email to przemko328@gmail.com

#Line distance between all points features
It utilizes delaunay triangulation to join nearest points to each other with lines and distance between them.

#Lines with distance to N-nearest neighbours - two different layers
It allows you to select specific point from one layer, specific amount of neighbours that are to be found from 2nd selected layer and then creates lines between features with calculated distance.

# Save/Load selection
It allows to save selected polygon features by id in form of csv file. Second one allows you to retreive and reselect saved id from the layer.
